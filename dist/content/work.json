As debt is submitted, the device squeezes a bloated dress-dummy torso through an elaborate pulley and winch system. Simultaneously, video of gold foil covered chocolate coins cascades down and accumulates at different heights according to amounts of debt. Absent viewer input, it randomly scrolls through the U.S. national debt, average student loan, and median gallery visitors’ debt that is projected upon audio-video of simmering fat.",
